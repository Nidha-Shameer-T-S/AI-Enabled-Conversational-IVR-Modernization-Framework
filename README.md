# AI-Enabled-Conversational-IVR-Modernization-Framework
## 📌 Project Overview

The **Conversational IVR Modernization Framework** is designed to transform legacy VoiceXML (VXML)-based Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems into intelligent, AI-powered conversational platforms.

This project integrates traditional IVR infrastructure with modern Conversational AI platforms such as **Azure Communication Services (ACS)** and **BAP Service**, enabling natural language voice interaction while minimizing redevelopment of existing backend systems.

The framework ensures a smooth transition from menu-driven workflows to dynamic, context-aware conversational experiences.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Modernize legacy VXML-based IVR systems
- Integrate Conversational AI (ACS/BAP)

## 🔍 Key Components

### 1️⃣ Legacy IVR System
- Built using VoiceXML (VXML)
- Menu-driven navigation
- DTMF-based interaction
- Backend API connectivity
